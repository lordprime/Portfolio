## Professional Experience

### CISPA -- Helmholtz Center for Information Security — Saarbrücken, Germany  
**Research Assistant (Web & AI Security)** — Sep 2025 – Present  
- **SW-WCD Research:** Developed `SW-WCD-RESEARCH`, a controlled prototype to study Service Worker-mediated Web Cache Deception. Architected a simulation environment using Nginx (CDN logic) and Express (Origin) to test path sculpting and header manipulation payloads.  
- **Infrastructure Automation:** Implemented a Playwright-based test suite for cross-browser validation and an R-based statistical engine to compute attack success rates and time-to-cache metrics.  
- **AI Agent Security (IDAD):** Leading the Vibecoding Security Gap study, benchmarking Agent-Native IDEs vs. CLI Agents. Designing the `XYZ Bench` framework to evaluate 275 development tasks for hallucinated dependencies, logic optimization bypasses, and security vulnerabilities.  
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** Uncovering novel Verification Gap, risks where autonomous agents report successful tests on vulnerable code, specifically in context poisoning and legacy pattern propagation & identifying Security Vuln.

### Hackers4u — Remote  
**Penetration Testing Intern** — Sep 2023 – Oct 2023  
- Executed black-box penetration tests on web applications, identifying critical vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, IDOR).  
- Automated network enumeration using Nmap and Nessus APIs, reducing manual scanning time by 40%.  
- Documented findings in markdown reports for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### CybersecuredIndia — Bangalore, India  
**Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics Intern** — Dec 2022 – Feb 2023  
- Analyzed malware behavior logs using Python to detect obfuscation patterns.  
- Conducted forensic investigations preserving chain-of-custody; reconstructed attack timelines using Registry and Prefetch artifacts.  
- Translated findings into actionable risk mitigation plans.

### Virtual Testing Foundation — Remote  
**Information Security Administrator Intern** — Sep 2022 – Nov 2022  
- Mapped adversary behaviors to controls using MITRE ATT&CK to identify gaps.  
- Assisted in drafting Information Security and Acceptable Use Policies (ISP/AUP).

## Key Projects & Research

### SW-WCD-RESEARCH: Web Cache Deception Prototype | _Docker, Nginx, Playwright, R, JS, SQL_ — Research  
- Engineered a complete research testbed to evaluate how Service Workers influence WCD behaviors in CDN-backed architectures.  
- Implemented Node.js anomaly detectors to log rewritten URLs and cache indicators.  
- Developed attack payloads (e.g., t1-path-sculpting.js) to bypass standard CDN cache armor.  
- Designed PostgreSQL schema for trial data storage and statistical power analysis.

### The Vibecoding Security Gap (IDAD Evaluation) | _Python, eBPF, Gemini 3.5, Claude Code_ — Research  
- Building `XYZ Bench` to compare Agent-Native IDEs vs. CLI agents across 275 software tasks.  
- Measuring hallucinated dependencies and context poisoning rates in autonomous coding.  
- Using eBPF to monitor insecure execution patterns in agent-generated code.

### Protocol Fuzzing | _Python, Fandango, SMTP, Redis-like Protocol_ — Course Project  
- Designed a stateful Fandango IO grammar for a Redis-like key-value store, enabling valid command sequences (SET/GET/UPDATE) with response validation.  
- Simulated an SMTP man-in-the-middle attack by hijacking authenticated sessions to send spoofed emails without hardcoded credentials.  
- Used derivation tree constraints and prefix-aware tracking to enforce protocol correctness during fuzzing.

### HACKBOT: AI-Powered Automated Exploit Engine | _Python, Meta-Llama 3, RunPod, RAG_ — GitHub
